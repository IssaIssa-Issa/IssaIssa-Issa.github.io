# Reverse Engineering Code

## Assignment


This will be an analysis I make of a folder provided to me. I will explain the relevance of each folder and what is contained within each folder. Below you woll also find a link to a video of me explaining each of my points.

* File Structure
              Markup : * config - Holds all configarations nestled in the code.
                  * middleware.
                    * isAuthenticated - is what holds the authenications needed for the application.
            * models.
                * index.js - is the functionality for the application.
                * user - is the funtionality for the user.
            * public
                * js - holds the functionality for the three main html pages the user will be accessing.
                * stylesheets - is the styling of the application the user sees.
                * three html pages that the user will access on different points depending on wether they sign in or sign up.
            * routes - holds the api routes and html routes created.
            * package.json - shows all the packages used in the application and can be shared with others simply by sending the package.json file.
            * server - the js file which holds the server and how it communicates with the other js files located within the folder.
